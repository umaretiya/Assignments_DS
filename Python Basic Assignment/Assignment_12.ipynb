    "Ans. The structure of a document is represented by three different data types in python-Docx. At the highest level, a Document object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of Paragraph objects for the paragraphs in the document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses ENTER or RETURN while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n",

A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes."
